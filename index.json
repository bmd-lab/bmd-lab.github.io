We report on all these candidates and discuss the structural and chemical factors leading to electride formation. Among these candidates, our work identifies the first partially filled 3d transition-metal-containing electrides Ba3CrN3 and Sr3CrN3, an unexpected finding that contravenes conventional chemistry.\n","date":1539126000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539126000,"objectID":"7496bfbeffde5625677b53f34135db69","permalink":"https://www.bmd-lab.org/featured/article/","publishdate":"2018-10-10T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/featured/article/","section":"featured","summary":"Analyzing a database of more than 60 000 compounds, we identify 65 new electride candidates and recover 4 already known.","tags":["Materials"],"title":"High-Throughput Identification of Electrides from All Known Inorganic Materials","type":"featured"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"The Seal of Excellence award is issued by the European Commission as an endorsement of scientists for future grant applications.\n","date":1492642800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555455600,"objectID":"0a82e317adbc2f2c6bdc7f6422dbc8b7","permalink":"https://www.bmd-lab.org/featured_news/soeaward/","publishdate":"2017-04-20T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/featured_news/soeaward/","section":"featured_news","summary":"The Seal of Excellence award is issued by the European Commission as an endorsement of scientists for future grant applications.","tags":["Award"],"title":"Lee Burton wins EU Seal of Excellence award 2017","type":"featured_news"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1492642800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555455600,"objectID":"c595867b719ffcbd4ccb4010f4c91439","permalink":"https://www.bmd-lab.org/news/soeaward/","publishdate":"2017-04-20T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/news/soeaward/","section":"news","summary":"The Seal of Excellence award is issued by the European Commission as an endorsement of scientists for future grant applications.","tags":["Award"],"title":"Lee Burton wins EU Seal of Excellence award 2017","type":"news"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.
