      <description>Lee A. Burton finished his PhD at the University of Bath in England in 2014. Since then he has been awarded 2 international post-doc fellowships (to work in Japan and Belgium) and the European Seal of Excellence in 2018.
His previous job was working as part of The Materials Project, screening all known materials for various applications from catalysis to hydrogen storage. Now he is hoping to use his expertise with handling big data to effectively incorporate machine learning into the process of property prediction and materials discovery.</description>
