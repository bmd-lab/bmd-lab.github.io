      <description>Our focus is the data-driven discovery of materials and semiconductors.
This means we use computers to model solids and predict their properties before they have been made.
We are mainly interested in materials that can be used for renewable energy and clean technology, such as solar panels.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to work with us, or have any feedback, we can be reached anytime via the form below.</description>
